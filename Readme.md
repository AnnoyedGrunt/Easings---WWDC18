This playground's goal is to introduce the user to the basics of computer animation in a simple and direct way by allowing them to modify and shape an easing curve using their own hands. The playground features an adaptable UI that scales and resizes to fit all different sizes available on the iPad Swift Playgrounds app.
The playground does not feature any external frameworks, being written completely using UIKit and its embedded frameworks. The code within the playground shows examples of constraint-setting using anchors and how to create custom views by manually manipulating layers and animating them.
